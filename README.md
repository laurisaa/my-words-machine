# my-words-machine receives the input of the actual word and then separates it into list of characters. It then processes each and every character to obtain the possible combination of all characters in that word and stores that complete set of words in the list. Dictionary.isEnglishWord is mocked in own class and checks for the valid word. If it is valid, it is added to the final list, if it is not, it will be skipped and continue processing other words.
